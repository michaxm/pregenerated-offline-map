This is a webpage and an fx-os app to display pregenerated (openstreetmap) tiles. It is meant for local subsets of mapdata, not the world data.

The display method for tiles and all basic setup is taken from https://github.com/kownet/poland-offline-map, I have started with a fresh history because of some example data, which I feel does not belong into the application logic and did not want as binary data in the history. Furthermore, I plan on reusing officially generated tiles and do not emphasize meta data enrichment.

To use it, local tiles have to be acquired for your needs. TODO Howto
